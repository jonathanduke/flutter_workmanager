# 0.8.0

## Major Architecture Changes
* **BREAKING**: Migrate to federated plugin architecture for better platform extensibility
* **BREAKING**: Platform-specific implementations moved to separate packages
* Create `workmanager_platform_interface` for shared platform interface
* Create `workmanager_android` package with Android WorkManager implementation
* Create `workmanager_apple` package with iOS BGTaskScheduler implementation
* Foundation for future macOS support using NSBackgroundActivityScheduler

## Breaking Changes
* **BREAKING**: Enum values changed from snake_case to camelCase:
  * `NetworkType` values: `not_required` → `notRequired`, `not_roaming` → `notRoaming`, `metered` → `metered` (unchanged)
  * `OutOfQuotaPolicy` values: `run_as_non_expedited_work_request` → `runAsNonExpeditedWorkRequest`, `drop_work_request` → `dropWorkRequest`
* **BREAKING**: Removed JSON serialization for inputData - now uses native Map transfer for better performance and type safety

## New Features
* Android: Added `isScheduledByUniqueName` method to check if a periodic task is scheduled by its unique name (Android only)
* Added comprehensive integration tests for better reliability

## Bug Fixes
* iOS: Fixed `initialDelaySeconds` parameter handling - was previously ignored
* Android: Fixed NullPointerException when `isInDebugMode` was not properly initialized
* Fixed inputData type handling across platforms - now properly supports all primitive types and lists
* iOS: Fixed compilation errors with Map handling
* iOS: Fixed swapped constraints bug for requiresNetworkConnectivity and requiresExternalPower by @thegriffen (from PR #562)
* Android: Fixed v2 embedding import in BackgroundWorker by @jogapps (from PR #595)

## Improvements
* Updated to Flutter 3.32 and flutter_lints 6.0.0
* Android: Updated target SDK to 35
* Improved CI/CD with Android emulator caching for faster builds
* Better error handling and type safety throughout the codebase
* iOS: Add Privacy Manifest for App Store compliance by @navaronbracke (from PR #555)
* iOS: Replace print statements with proper os_log for better logging
* iOS: printScheduledTasks now returns String instead of void by @yarith28 (from PR #585)
* Android: Fix documentation formatting and typo in BackgroundWorker by @jogapps (from PR #595)
